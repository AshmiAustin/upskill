        <h2>why being a part of upskil</h2>
        <p class="para">I was hoping to learn web programming for about a year. We got this vacation somehow, and I was planning to study HTML, CSS, and other things.
            When I found out that Tinkerhub was doing an upskilling program, I thought it would be easier to study web programming in a group. That's how I became involved with this.
